          The Birth of Planet Earth: A Cosmic Journey Through Time
        </h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Introduction:</strong> Have you ever wondered how our planet
          came to be? Join me as we explore the incredible story of Earth’s
          formation, from cosmic explosions to the birth of life itself.
        </p>

        <h2>The Cosmic Beginning: Solar Nebula and Supernova</h2>
        <p>
          About 4.6 billion years ago, a vast cloud of gas and dust, known as
          the Solar Nebula, floated through empty space. A nearby supernova
          created gravitational instability, sparking the formation of the
          Proto-Planetary Disk. These early collisions formed the Sun and
          planets, including Earth.
        </p>

        <h2>Accretion: Building Blocks of Planets</h2>
        <p>
          The process of accretion explains how tiny particles in the solar
          nebula clumped together to form planetesimals and later protoplanets.
          Modern meteorites reveal insights into this cosmic construction.
        </p>

        <h2>The Hadean Eon: Earth's Hellish Start</h2>
        <p>
          During the Hadean Eon, Earth faced a fiery beginning with massive
          collisions and volcanic activity. Water from comets and asteroids
          played a vital role in stabilizing the environment and setting the
          stage for life.
        </p>

        <h2>Layers of Earth: The Great Divide</h2>
        <p>
          Earth's layers formed due to gravity and heat, with heavy elements
          forming the core and lighter materials rising to create the crust.
          These layers drive geological phenomena like earthquakes and volcanic
          eruptions.
        </p>

        <h2>The Moon's Formation: A Giant Impact</h2>
        <p>
          The Giant Impact Hypothesis suggests a Mars-sized protoplanet, Theia,
          collided with Earth, forming the Moon. This event gave Earth its axial
          tilt and seasons while stabilizing its climate.
        </p>

        <h2>Earth’s Conditions for Life: A Perfect Balance</h2>
        <p>
          Earth evolved into a life-supporting planet with volcanic activity
          creating a complex atmosphere and water pooling in vast reservoirs.
          Its magnetic field and greenhouse gases maintain a delicate balance
          for life to thrive.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          From cosmic chaos to life-sustaining conditions, Earth's journey is
          miraculous. Understanding this history inspires us to appreciate and
          protect our extraordinary planet for future generations.
