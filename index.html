        <h2>The Cosmic Beginning: Solar Nebula and Supernova</h2>
        <p>
          About 4.6 billion years ago, a vast cloud of gas and dust, known as
          the Solar Nebula, floated through space. A nearby supernova created
          gravitational instability, leading to the formation of the
          Proto-Planetary Disk, where Earth began its journey.

        <h2>Accretion: Building Blocks of Planets</h2>
        <p>
          The process of accretion explains how tiny particles in the solar
          nebula clumped together to form planetesimals and protoplanets, laying
          the groundwork for Earth and other celestial bodies.

        <h2>The Hadean Eon: Earth's Hellish Start</h2>
        <p>
          During the Hadean Eon, Earth endured massive collisions and volcanic
          activity. Water from comets and asteroids helped stabilize the
          environment, setting the stage for life.

        <h2>Layers of Earth: The Great Divide</h2>
        <p>
          Earth's layers formed due to gravity and heat, with heavy elements
          forming the core and lighter materials creating the crust. These
          layers drive geological phenomena like earthquakes and volcanic
          eruptions.

        <h2>The Moon's Formation: A Giant Impact</h2>
        <p>
          The Giant Impact Hypothesis suggests that a Mars-sized protoplanet
          collided with Earth, forming the Moon. This event gave Earth its axial
          tilt and seasons while stabilizing its climate.

        <h2>Earth’s Conditions for Life: A Perfect Balance</h2>
        <p>
          Volcanic activity, water, and a magnetic field contributed to Earth’s
          ability to support life, showcasing its finely tuned processes.
